#Let's write our code here
##Test the following functions using MAX 10 tweets at a time to avoid long run times 

#write function to pull tweets with our specific parameters in mind


#write function to create a dictionary with word frequencies 


Etc....







Goal is to access the twitter API and collect English tweets in the Ann Arbor area over a period of 3 days.
 We’d create a dictionary of words from these tweets.
We’d then collect 3 days of tweets 3 weeks later and identify words that increase in frequency.
Those words would be labelled “slang”. (since we’re only using 2 time slices, we’d likely not include words that had 0 mentions in the first instance as a way to avoid an infinite frequency increase)
Then we’d search through Urban Dictionary API to see if we can pull the definition of those slang words.
We’d then display the 5 words with the largest slang
